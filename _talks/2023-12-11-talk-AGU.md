**Abstract:** Methane, the main part of natural gas, is the second biggest cause of climate change after carbon dioxide. Even though it doesn't stick around as long, it traps heat even better. So, if we can cut down on methane quickly, it can really help slow down global warming. Oil and gas sector gives off about 14% of total methane, so reducing how much they emit can make a big difference. For methane monitoring, we usually put multiple sensors around the site to catch all the emissions. But this method might not work best because it doesn't take into account the emission and wind behaviors at that specific site. In our research, we've come up with a smarter way to place these sensors. We use data to help decide where to put them based on where and how emission occurs and how wind moves around the site. This method involves three steps: modeling how wind and emission behaves and generating emission scenarios based on this information, evaluating emission detection at each possible sensor location, and figuring out the best locations to put the sensors that work together for maximum emission monitoring performance.
